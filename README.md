## Description
Cisco ucsm_dockerdc_puppet module allows administrators to automate all aspects of Cisco UCS management including server, network, storage and hypervisor management. Bulk of the Cisco ucsm_dockerdc_puppet module work on the UCS Managerâ€™s Management Information Tree (MIT), performing create, modify or delete actions on the Managed Objects (MO) in the tree. 
The resources and capabilities provided by this Puppet Module will grow with contributions from Cisco, Puppet Labs and the open source community.
Dependencies

The ucsm_dockerdc_puppet module has a dependency on the ucsmsdk python library. See the Setup section that follows for more information on ucsmsdk.

Contributing

Contributions to the ciscopuppet module are welcome. See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.

## Setup
Puppet Master

To install git use the following command :
   yum install git -y
The ucsm_dockerdc_puppet module must be cloned on the Puppet Master server. We recommend cloning in the modules directory.

   https://github.com/pavan-koundinya/ucsm.git 
  
To install pip package installer use the following commands.
   - curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"
   - python get-pip.py
After pip is installed successfully install the ucsmsdk package using the following command.
   - pip install ucsmsdk
   
   


Software version Dependencies
   - Puppet 4.x
   - Python 2.7.x

## Reference

Here, include a complete list of your module's classes, types, providers,
facts, along with the parameters for each. Users refer to this section (thus
the name "Reference") to find specific details; most users don't read it per
se.

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc. If there
are Known Issues, you might want to include them under their own heading here.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them
know what the ground rules for contributing are.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc. **Optional**

If you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should
consider using changelog). You can also add any additional sections you feel
are necessary or important to include here. Please use the `## ` header.
